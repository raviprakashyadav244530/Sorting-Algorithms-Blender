🔹 Overview
This project is personally developed by Raj Ravi to help students and developers learn sorting algorithms visually.
It uses Blender’s Python API to generate 3D objects and animate their movement to show element comparisons and swaps during sorting.

⚡ Features
✅ Custom-built 3D animations
✅ Multiple visualization styles (Color, Rotation, Scaling, 3D cube)
✅ Real-time swaps and comparison counters
✅ Beginner-friendly Python scripts
✅ Supports 7+ popular sorting algorithms

🛠️ Installation
Requirements
Blender (latest version recommended)

Python (included with Blender)

Steps
Clone this repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/rajravi244530/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer.git
cd Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer
Open Blender → Text Editor

Load any sorting script from the src/ folder

Click Run Script

▶️ Usage
After running the script, press Play on the timeline

Watch the sorting process animated in 3D

Try different scripts to see different algorithms

📋 Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Selection Sort

Heap Sort

Shell Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

📊 Big O Complexity
Algorithm	Best	Average	Worst	Space
Quick Sort	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n²)	O(log n)
Merge Sort	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n)
Heap Sort	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(1)
Bubble Sort	O(n)	O(n²)	O(n²)	O(1)
Insertion Sort	O(n)	O(n²)	O(n²)	O(1)
Selection Sort	O(n²)	O(n²)	O(n²)	O(1)
Shell Sort	O(n log n)	O(n(log n)²)	O(n(log n)²)	O(1)

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔊 Sound effects for swaps and comparisons

➕ Add more algorithms (Radix, Bucket, Counting)

🎥 Auto camera adjustment for large arrays

🎨 Custom UI panel for selecting algorithms and colors

🛠️ Optimized merge sort animation
